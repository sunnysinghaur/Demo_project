Email OTP Verificartion
Email OTP verification is a security mechanism used to confirm a user's identity by sending a unique code to their email address. The user must enter this code on the verification page to complete the authentication process. This system enhances security by ensuring that the user has access to the email address they provided.
Implementation (HTML,CSS,J)
1 HTML: Contains two forms, one for entering the email to receive the OTP and another for entering the received OTP.
2 CSS: Provides basic styling for the forms.
3 JavaScript:
Listens for form submissions.
Simulates sending an OTP and displays the OTP input form.
Verifies the entered OTP against a stored value (for simplicity, stored in localStorage).
In a real-world application, the OTP would be generated and sent by a server-side script, and the verification would also be handled server-side for better security.
